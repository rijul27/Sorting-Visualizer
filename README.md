# Sorting-Visualizer
• Showcasing various sorting algorithms through an interactive interface. • Provides a practical and engaging platform for users to deepen their understanding of sorting algorithms. • Educational tool for algorithmic understanding.

The Sorting Visualizer project is an interactive and educational tool designed to showcase various sorting algorithms through a visually engaging interface. The platform serves as a practical means for users to deepen their understanding of sorting algorithms, allowing them to witness the step-by-step process of sorting in real-time.

The project incorporates several popular sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort. Each algorithm is meticulously implemented to accurately represent its functioning, providing users with a comprehensive experience of how these algorithms operate on a set of data.

The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to input a dataset and observe how each sorting algorithm rearranges the elements into the correct order. This visual representation not only aids in grasping the inner workings of the algorithms but also facilitates a more profound comprehension of their efficiency, trade-offs, and performance characteristics.
